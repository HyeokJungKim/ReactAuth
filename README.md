# Auth

### What is Auth/Why do we care?

### How do we implement Auth in a React/Rails Application?

### What is LocalStorage? How can we use it to persist our Auth?

## TODO

- [ ] Using JWT with JavaScript
  - [ ] `fetch` to get JWT token.
  - [ ] `fetch` + JWT token to test our auth'ed endpoints.
- [ ] Incorporating Auth in React
  - [ ] Login with `LoginForm`.
  - [ ] Get some data to display using our JWT token.
  - [ ] Save our JWT token somewhere.
  - [ ] Show that we are logged in somewhere.

  - [ ] Register with `RegisterForm`.
  - [ ] Add `Redirect`s to protect our routes.
  - [ ] Add a logout button.
